# Employee-Absenteeism-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
This project leverages Machine Learning techniques to analyze and predict employee absenteeism. The objective is to identify patterns, predict absenteeism duration, and classify employees at risk of frequent absences.

# Employee Absenteeism Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project analyzes **employee absenteeism** using **Machine Learning techniques** to identify absenteeism trends, predict absence duration, and classify employees at risk of frequent absences.

## Key Insights
- **Age & Education Impact:** Employees **above 53 years** and **with a high school education** have the **highest absenteeism**.
- **Reasons for Absence:** Includes **illness, transportation issues, and personal matters**.
- **Predicting Absence Duration:** 
  - **Linear Regression Model** used for predictions.
  - Performance metrics:
    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** X.XX  
    - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** X.XX  
    - **RÂ² Score:** X.XX  

- **Employee Risk Classification:** 
  - **Logistic Regression & KNN models** were built to classify high absenteeism employees.
  - **KNN performed better than Logistic Regression.**

## Techniques Used
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **Predictive Modeling (Linear Regression)**
- **Classification (Logistic Regression & KNN)**
